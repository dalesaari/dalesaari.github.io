Everything is very basic right now, but between pipelined projects and online coursework things should be added semi-regularly. Currently about a month and a half gap due to taking online courses to learn new technologies. As these courses wrap up, look for new projects to pop up as I test what I learned!

### About Me

I'm an Electrical Engineer looking to pivot my career towards software development. My biggest interests at the moment are learning more web frameworks and DevOps.

My current programming knowledge is pretty limited to C from my work in embedded firmware, Java from my schooling (CS electives were definitely the most fun!), and C# from previous personal projects (unfortunately from before I was using github). I expect most of my future projects to move away from C.

Current Courses I am working on:

```markdown
Linux Academy AWS Essentials

- Intent to complete AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate
- Expecting course completion and certification prep May 17 2020

The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery

- Udemy Course
1. HTML (already comfortable)
2. CSS (already comfortable)
3. JavaScript (Working on this right now, May 11 2020)
4. node.js (most esxcited to begin the section)
5. React
6. Much, much more

```

As a current Linux user (Manjaro 19.0.2 w/ i3), I also hope to become familiar with more advanced features and processes within Linux.

There isn't anything in the wiki, I just thought it would be fun to make a wiki
